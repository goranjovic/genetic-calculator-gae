#Genetic Calculator - GAE Version

##Introduction

Genetic Calculator is genetic algorithm implemented in Clojure that finds an equation that uses given numbers and any number of basic mathematical operations to calculate the given result (or a number as close to it as possible).

Goal of this project is to illustrate use of genetic algorithms, functional programming, and new programming language Clojure on example of a mathematical game.

##About the game

Objective of the game is to use 6 numbers and any of the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to create an equation equal to the given goal value. If such equation does not exist, goal is to find an equation whose value is as close to goal as possible.

###Additional rules:

Not all 6 numbers have to be used, omitting is permitted.
Only integer values are permitted, both in input numbers, and the result (challenged only by division operation)
Unary operations are not allowed, i.e. using minus operation to negate a number.
